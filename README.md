# 🔧 Here is my solution to the Ai Arrow 24 hackathon

This project aims to provide automated tools and interactive features that enrich both the gameplay and storytelling aspects of DnD sessions.


The main language of the game is Russian
## 📁 Project structure
The project consists of 3 services: a user application, an organizer application, and a server

`admin_app` - Organizer's applications. Needed for creating new game rooms and uploading game history to pdf file.

`user_app` - Custom Application. Realize directly the game functionality itself with adaptations of the scenario, characters and the game itself to the person's preferences.

`server` - Server. Handles application requests and is responsible for shaping files, scripts and all game mechanics.

`Models_Exp.ipynb` - Jupiter notebook, which provides the code for selecting the best LLM in our problem.


## 📋 Features
- 📩 Uploading history to pdf
  
- 🤖 All generated by the AI
  
- 👽 Generation of characters by description and their hakaracteristics (strength, intellect, charisma, dexterity)

- 🖼 Picture generation

- 🎧 Custom music selection

- ⌚️ Game duration control

- 🎤 Voice input

- 💬 The presence of dialogs and different premises

- 🛠 Flexible pipeline

## ❗️important

The service is currently running through APIs to GigaChat and Kandinsky, so you need to create an .env in the server directory with the following format to get started:
```env
CREADENTIALS_gigachat=...
cleint_id_gigachat=...

API_kandinsky=...
Secret_key_API_kandinsky=...

SECRET=...
```
The SECRET here is your own key to the organizer app. This is to prevent anyone else from creating rooms so they don't waste your money

## 🚀 Installation:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/funmagster/Ai_Arrow24.git
   ```
   
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run:

   3.1 To start the server (specify your host and port):
   
   ```bash
   cd server
   uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
   ```
   3.2 To run applications:
   ```bash
   cd admin_app
   python main.py
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   cd user_app
   python main.py
   ```
   
4. [Download the video for the user app and paste it into the appropriate directory](https://github.com/funmagster/Ai_Arrow24/blob/main/user_app/video/README.md)
